# Video Game Recommender
This is a project to recommend Steam video games based on user preferences and similar users. I made this project as part of a workshop for Data Club at Northeastern University.

I integrated react components and a REST API to display 20,000+ Steam video games. I also created a recommendation engine to generate a list of top 10 recommended video games for a user.
